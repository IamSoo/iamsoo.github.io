ELK is a stack of 3 projects/application and mostly used together for ingestion + in-memory storage + display.
Each component can be run separately and can be integrated with other components as well. The stack is named from 
Elastic Search, Logstash and Kibana. Though the name looks cool but sometimes I think why they did not name the stack 
as per the usage of the application. Because during implementation Elastic search comes between Logstash and Kibana.

Anyways its non of our business to care about the ELK stack.
Let's discuss more about ELK and do hands on to see how it works.
